  <h3> Hi {{Name}}, </h3> 

  <strong>Welcome to Dietitian Your Way! </strong>


  <p>Dietitian Your Way started with the #1 priority: to help clients get the attention and care they deserve from highly educated and verified nutritionists. In a society where everyone seems to be a nutrition expert, Dietitian Your Way is here to help differentiate between the faux pas and the true food and nutrition experts: Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDN).</p>

  <p>At Dietitian Your Way, we understand many of us experience nutrition in different ways. Our religion, sexual orientation, cultures and our languages make a difference in how we experience nutrition care.<p>

  <p>That is why Dietitian Your Way is here to cater to your individual needs. We want you to feel well taken care of by health care professionals that align with you- including verified RDN’s. </p>

  <p>We will be sending you a follow up email letting you know when DYW site has been launched. In the meantime feel free to check out our social media for updates and more! </p><br>
